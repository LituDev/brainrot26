# The ROT26 Public License (ROT26-PL) Version 26.0.0

Copyright (c) 2025 The ROT26 Certification Authority
All rights reserved, then rotated, then reserved again.

By viewing this license, you agree to rotate all its terms by 26 positions in your mind.

## Terms and Conditions

1. Definitions
   - "The Algorithm" refers to the process of rotating text by 26 positions
   - "Double ROT13" is a trademark of people who didn't get there first
   - "Security" means the absence of understanding
   - "User" refers to anyone brave enough to use this
   - "Supercomputer" means any device capable of adding numbers up to 26

2. Grant of Rights
   You are hereby granted the right to:
   a) Rotate text clockwise by 26 positions
   b) Rotate text counterclockwise by 26 positions
   c) Achieve the same result by doing nothing
   d) Claim this was intentional

3. Restrictions
   You may not:
   - Implement ROT25 or ROT27, as these are unstable
   - Use ROT13 twice and call it ROT26
   - Point out that rotating by 26 returns the original text
   - Use this in production (but you weren't going to anyway)
   - Calculate that 26 mod 26 equals 0
   - Think too hard about what this algorithm actually does

4. Warranty
   This software is provided "as is", where "is" has been rotated 26 times for security purposes. No warranty is provided, as that would make it easier to sue us.

5. Disclaimer
   The authors accept no responsibility for:
   - Data that looks exactly the same after encryption
   - Confused users
   - Confused developers
   - Confused computers
   - Mathematical inevitabilities
   - Lost productivity spent implementing this
   - Time spent reading this license

6. Contribution
   By contributing to this project, you certify that:
   - You understand that you don't understand
   - Your contributions will be rotated 26 times before review
   - You won't tell anyone what ROT26 actually does
   - You'll maintain the illusion of complexity

7. Patent Rights
   We hereby patent the concept of adding 26 to letter positions modulo 26. Any implementation of basic arithmetic may be subject to licensing fees.

8. Termination
   This license terminates automatically if you:
   - Implement a more efficient solution
   - Use basic mathematics
   - Think critically
   - Read this section

9. Indemnification
   You agree to indemnify the authors against any claims that this software:
   - Does nothing
   - Is pointless
   - Is just returning the input
   - Is a waste of CPU cycles
   (Even though all of these may be technically accurate)

10. Legal Enforcement
    This license shall be enforced in the Court of Circular Logic, presided over by judges who have been rotated 26 times.

11. Export Compliance
    This software is subject to ROT26 export control laws, which are exactly the same as having no export control laws, but more secure.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, THEN ROTATED 26 TIMES, THEN PROVIDED AGAIN "AS IS" FOR DOUBLE THE SECURITY.

END OF LICENSE (PLEASE ROTATE 26 TIMES BEFORE READING)

Note: If this license appears to make no sense, you may need to rotate your understanding by 26 positions.
